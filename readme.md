## Installation
Because this extension is still in development and is not available on the Chrome extensions store, you must manually install this program on your computer to run it.
1. Download the source code. You can download it as `.zip` from the green "<> Code" button above, or you may clone the repository.
2. Extract the content of `germsfox-main.zip` to its own folder.
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser's search bar.
4. On the left side of the page, click on "Load unpacked".
5. When prompted to select a file, select the `germsfox-main` folder you previously extracted from its `.zip` file.

Should be good from here. If you have any issues, ping me @pc31754 on Discord!
