# Germsfox
## Description
Germsfox is a multiboxing extension for https://germs.io/ which aims to implement some necessary features to help make the game less bad.
## Features
- Adds a settings button for multiboxing in windowed or tabbed mode
    - Detects when you're chatting to prevent accidental switches
- Custom skins list
- Set lower animation delay, input multiple-lined names, send longer chat messages.
## Installation
Because this extension is still in development and is not available on the Firefox extensions store, you must manually install this program on your computer to run it.
1. Download the source code. You can download it as `.zip` from the blue "<> Code" button above, or you may clone the repository.
2. Extract the content of `germsfox-main.zip` to its own folder.
3. Navigate to `about:debugging` in your browser's search bar.
4. On the left side of the page, click on "This Firefox," and then click "Load Temporary Add-on..." on the proceeding screen.
5. When prompted to select a file, select any file within the `germsfox-main` folder you previously extracted from its `.zip` file.

Should be good from here. If you have any issues, contact me @pc31754 on Discord!
